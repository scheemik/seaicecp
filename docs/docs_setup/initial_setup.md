# Initial Setup

This guide details how the architecture of this project was developed.
For streamlined instructions on how to install and start using this project, see the {doc}`Installation <installation>` page.

The structure of this project is based on the incredibly helpful guide, [Py-Pkgs](https://py-pkgs.org/welcome).
Several of the sections below are summarizations of parts of that guide, with details of the changes I made for this specific setup.

## The order of operations

When initially setting up this project, I installed the [`uv` package manager](#uv_manager), [created the package structure](#pkg_structure) of the project, and [installed Python dependencies in a virtual environment](#venv) all before writing the [Podman](#podman) container.
It is likely that one could avoid installing `uv` on their host system by first setting up the container and, once inside the container, create the package structure.
However, I present those steps first as I have not tested that possibility and thus present them in the manner I followed, outside the container.
I do, however, place the section on the [virtual environment and installing package dependencies](#venv) after creating the container in this document because I have confirmed that adding packages with `uv` inside the container works.

---
<a id='uv_manager'></a>
[back to top](#top)

## The `uv` package manager

In [Py-Pkgs Chapter 2](https://py-pkgs.org/02-setup), they suggest to use Miniconda to create an environment and use [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. 
For this project, I decided to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead. 
From the instructions for [Installing `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), I used Homebrew.
I've truncated the output below for brevity. 
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ brew install uv
==> Auto-updating Homebrew...
Adjust how often this is run with `$HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS` or disable with
`$HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1`. Hide these hints with `$HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS=1` (see `man brew`).
==> Downloading https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/portable-ruby/blobs/sha256:7c7830166a509857669c544dcba7a0d08ca656a3da073c68826ca0a5b1b56b12

Updated 2 taps (homebrew/core and homebrew/cask).
...
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/uv/0.11.6: 17 files, 54.0MB
```

I then ensured that I had the most up-to-date version of `uv` installed.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ brew upgrade uv
Warning: uv 0.11.6 already installed
```

## Creating a package structure

<a id='uv_init'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Using `uv init`

To start a project, I simply need to use `uv` to initiate one, following the [Working on projects](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/) guide.
I chose the name `seaicecp` to stand for "Sea Ice Choke Points," trying to balance brevity and descriptiveness.
First, I navigated to the directory in which I want my project to be, `<absolute/path/to/project>`, then used the `uv init` command with the name for the project and the `--package` flag.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ cd /<absolute/path/to/project>
Grey@Audron:/<absolute/path/to/project>$ uv init seaicecp --package
Initialized project `seaicecp` at `/<absolute/path/to/project>/seaicecp`
```

This creates a very simple directory structure for the project.
```console
Grey@Audron:/<absolute/path/to/project>$ tree seaicecp
├── .gitignore
├── .python-version
├── README.md
├── main.py
└── pyproject.toml
```

<a id='cookiecutter'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Using a `cookiecutter` template

In [Py-Pkgs Section 2.2.2](https://py-pkgs.org/02-setup#install-packaging-software), they suggest installing `cookiecutter` to create a package from a pre-made template. 
This package is then actually used in [Section 3.2.2](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#creating-a-package-structure). 
I do like the package structure they provide with their `cookiecutter` template, but I will need to integrate it with the directory structure generated above with `uv init` as their template assumes using `poetry` as a dependency manager.

`uv` comes the ability to [invoke a tool without installing it by using `uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/#running-tools). 
This is helpful when trying something out, or when using a tool that is just for an initial set up, like [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter), which can be used to create a package structure.
By using `uvx`, you don't need to commit to actually installing `cookiecutter` on your system.

First, I created and went into a temporary directory, `tmp_dir`, then generated the package structure.
This is to ensure I didn't accidentally overwrite the structure I made with `uv init` earlier.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ mkdir tmp_dir
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ cd tmp_dir
Grey@Audron:tmp_dir$ git branch -m master main
$ uvx cookiecutter https://github.com/py-pkgs/py-pkgs-cookiecutter.git
Installed 21 packages in 137ms
  [1/7] author_name (Monty Python): Mikhail Schee
  [2/7] package_name (mypkg): seaicecp
  [3/7] package_short_description (A package for doing great things!): Investigate sea ice choke points in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using high-resolution models.
  [4/7] package_version (0.1.0): 
  [5/7] python_version (3.12): 3.13.5
  [6/7] Select open_source_license
    1 - MIT
    2 - Apache License 2.0
    3 - GNU General Public License v3.0
    4 - CC0 v1.0 Universal
    5 - BSD 3-Clause
    6 - Proprietary
    7 - None
    Choose from [1/2/3/4/5/6/7] (1): 
  [7/7] Select include_github_actions
    1 - no
    2 - ci
    3 - ci+cd
    Choose from [1/2/3] (1):
```

This generates a directory with the chosen package name (in this case, `seaicecp`) and fill it with all the boiler-plate files you would expect in a Python Package.
```console
Grey@Audron:tmp_dir$ tree seaicecp/

<a id='uv_and_cookiecutter'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Combining `uv` and `cookiecutter` structures

Below are the files that are shared across both structures I generated and what changes I needed to make.
- The `src/` directory
    - Use the version generated by the `cookiecutter`.
- `.gitignore`
    - Use the version generated by the `cookiecutter` as it is more extensive.
- `README.md`
    - Use the version generated by the `cookiecutter` as the one generated by `uv init` will be blank.
- `pyproject.toml`
    - Use the version generated by `uv init` as a base.
    - Copy in the lines from the `cookiecutter` version that start with:
        - `description`
        - `authors`
        - `license`

The `pyproject.toml` file initially looks like:
```toml
[project]
name = "seaicecp"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Investigate sea ice choke points in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago using high-resolution models."
authors = [
    { name = "Mikhail Schee", email = "mikhail.schee@alumni.utoronto.ca" }
]
license = "MIT"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.13"
dependencies = [
    
]

[dependency-groups]
dev = [
    "ipykernel>=7.2.0",
]

[project.scripts]
seaicecp = "seaicecp:main"

[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build>=0.9.15,<0.10.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"
```

After completing those steps, I deleted the redundant instance of my project directory in `tmp_dir`. 
```console
Grey@Audron:tmp_dir$ cd ..
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ rm -rf tmp_dir/
```

<a id='version_control'></a>
[back to top](#top)

## Version control and GitHub

Following [Py-Pkgs Section 3.3. Put your package under version control](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#put-your-package-under-version-control), I initiated `git` for my new repository.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /<absolute/path/to/project>/seaicecp/.git/
```

I then added and committed the initial structure and pushed to a new [GitHub repository for the project](https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp).
I am working in VSCodium, which I'd already set up to [connect to my GitHub account](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/blob/master/docs/usage.md#signin-github), so the process was as simple as pressing the "push" button in the GUI.

<a id='default_branch'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Setting the default branch

For the version of `git` I have, it still sets the default branch as `master` instead of `main`. 
I'm following the guide from Geeks for Geeks on [How to Change Git Default Branch From Master?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git/how-to-change-git-default-branch-from-master/)

First, I renamed the local branch.
```console
Grey@Audron:/<absolute/path/to/project>$ cd seaicecp
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ git branch -m master main
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ git push -u origin main
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: 
remote: Create a pull request for 'main' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp/pull/new/main
remote: 
To https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'.
```

Then, on GitHub, I went to the "Settings" tab for the repository, then confirmed I was in the "General" section on the sidebar.
Under the heading "Default branch," I clicked the button to "Switch to another branch," selected `main`, then hit "Update."
Next, I deleted the `master` branch from the remote.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ git push origin --delete master
To https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp.git
 - [deleted]         master
```

Since the repository had not been cloned anywhere else at this point, that was all I needed to do.

## Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is an open-source tool by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en0) for creating and managing containers, similar to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
[Containerization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Containerization_(computing)) allows the creation of isolated, reproducible computing environments, making it easier to ensure code will run the same way across different systems.
While virtual environments for Python, such as [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download), create reproducible environments for Python packages, containers create reproducible environments for an entire operating system.
This allows the inclusion and management of non-Python software in a project, such as the `cdo` and `esgpull` tools used in this project.

<a id='podman_install'></a>

### Installing Podman
<!-- See GPBS_Log 2026/04/28 -->

I installed `podman` on my MacBook following the [Podman Installation Instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation). 
I downloaded the `podman-installer-macos-universal.pkg` version from the [`podman` GitHub latest release (v5.8.2) page](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases). 
Opening that brought me through the familiar GUI software installation process common to many applications for macOS. 
I agreed to the [license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/), selected which users for whom I will install it, then watched the loading bar. 
It took less than a minute. 

This process also added an item from "Red Hat" in Settings -> Login Items & Extensions -> Allow in the Background. 
I assume this is necessary for this to actually run properly. 
I then moved the `.pkg` file to the trash.

The next step in the [Podman Installation Instructions](https://podman.io/docs/installation) for macOS is to setup the Podman virtual machine.
This is necessary when running Podman on macOS or Windows as it needs to run on a Linux system, therefore I need to initialize a virtual machine to actually run Podman.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman machine init
Looking up Podman Machine image at quay.io/podman/machine-os:5.8 to create VM
Getting image source signatures
Copying blob 5efcf56a5999 done   | 
Copying config 44136fa355 done   | 
Writing manifest to image destination
5efcf56a599919c786136faf8e4f48b25bf3865b5e8ea3302f6d705ba750afec
Extracting compressed file: podman-machine-default-amd64.raw: done  
Machine init complete
To start your machine run:

	podman machine start
```
That took about 3 minutes.
Next, I started the virtual machine.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman machine start
Starting machine "podman-machine-default"

This machine is currently configured in rootless mode. If your containers
require root permissions (e.g. ports < 1024), or if you run into compatibility
issues with non-podman clients, you can switch using the following command:

	podman machine set --rootful

API forwarding listening on: /var/run/docker.sock
Docker API clients default to this address. You do not need to set DOCKER_HOST.

Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully
```
That took about a minute. 
Then, I took a look at the `podman` information.
There is quite a lot of information, so I'll collapse most of the output.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman info

### Testing Podman

Next, I followed the [Basic Setup and Use of Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman_tutorial.md) guide.
To start, I ran the sample `nginx` container, calling it `basic_httpd`.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman run --name basic_httpd -d -p 8080:80/tcp docker.io/nginx
Trying to pull docker.io/library/nginx:latest...

```
This pulls the image from the web, builds it, and starts a container running that image.
If the above command is run a second time, it will be able to skip the part where it downloads and builds the image.
I can now list my running containers.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                           COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS             PORTS                 NAMES
774a97cf2828  docker.io/library/nginx:latest  nginx -g daemon o...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute  0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp  basic_httpd
```
Adding the `-a` flag shows "all" containers, but that doesn't result in any different output than without it at this moment because I just have the one container.

Then, I can inspect that running container.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman inspect basic_httpd | grep IPAddress
               "IPAddress": "10.88.0.3",
                         "IPAddress": "10.88.0.3",
```
This is different than what is shown in the guide which says:
> "As the container is running in rootless mode, an IP address is not assigned and the value will be listed as 'none' in the output from inspect." 

<!-- So, I'm not sure if I am running rootless or not as I did, in fact, get an IP address. -->

Next, I tested the `httpd` server to make sure it is running on the expected port, displaying the index page.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ curl http://localhost:8080

Using the Container ID from the `podman ps` command above, I can see the logs of this container.

I can also see the `httpd pid` with `top` using the same container ID.
```console

```
<!-- [Checkpointing podman containers](https://podman.io/docs/checkpoint) is only available with root containers, so I'm going to skip that for now. -->

Next, I'll be following part of the guide [How to run your first rootless container with Podman](https://cloudqubes.com/letters/how-to-run-your-first-rootless-container-with-podman).
One of the benefits of Podman is the ability to run containers as "rootless" which adds an extra layer of security. 
The `podman exec <container_name>` command allows you to execute commands within a container.
I will use this to execute the `whoami` command to ask who the container thinks they are.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman exec basic_httpd whoami
root
```
So, the container is running as `root`. 
Next, I'll see who owns the process.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman top basic_httpd user huser
USER        HUSER
root        502
nginx       100100
nginx       100100
nginx       100100
nginx       100100
```
I can see here that the user id between `root` and the `nginx` container don't match, so it seems like that confirms that even though, inside the container, the service is running as `root`, outside the container, it is not.

Next, I can stop the container.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman stop basic_httpd
basic_httpd
```
Then, I'll remove this container and check to make sure it is gone.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman rm basic_httpd
basic_httpd
Grey@Audron:~$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES

### Pod Manager extension for VSCodium

I went to VSCodium and installed the "Pod Manager" extension from user `dreamcatcher45`. 
When I first went into the extension, I got the following error:
```console
Failed to get containers: Error: Command failed: podman container ls -a --format "{{.ID}}|{{.Names}}|{{.Status}}|{{.Labels}}"
/bin/sh: podman: command not found
```
I figured out that VSCodium had been open since before I installed `podman`, and I couldn't actually run `podman version` in the VSCodium terminal panel. 
After I restarted VSCodium, both the `podman version` command and the Pod Manager extension worked.

In the sidebar of VSCodium, I clicked on the Pod Manger icon, which looks like a stylized seal.
Currently, the dropdown for "Containers" is empty because I remove the ones I was testing above.
However, under the "Images" dropdown, I see "docker.io/library/nginx:latest (7aaca76c508f)."
This is the image that was built when [Testing Podman](#podman_test).

Containers get added to the list in the Pod Manager sidebar when they start running. 
I can start the `basic_httpd` container again.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman run --name basic_httpd -d -p 8080:80/tcp docker.io/nginx
9ab04fb2f7c04e2a1cf263ee46b33a00cde5fc7c89e71926f7a65aeae4e35dd7
```
Since this image was already built, all that needed to be done was start a container with the image.
Hitting the refresh button next to the overall "Resources" dropdown at the top of the Pod Manager sidebar reveals this `basic_httpd` container. 
The container name has a long alphanumeric string in parentheses appended which changes every time the container is started.

When hovering over the name of the container, several options appear.
One of these is to "Open in Terminal" which does the equivalent of opening a new terminal inside VSCodium and entering the container, all in one click.
From there, commands can be executed inside the container.
```console
podman exec -it 9ab04fb2f7c0 /bin/sh

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman exec -it 9ab04fb2f7c0 /bin/sh
# basic_httpd whoami
root
# 
```
Then, to clean up, I will stop and remove this `basic_httpd` from outside the container.
```console
Grey@Audron:~$ podman stop basic_httpd
basic_httpd
Grey@Audron:~$ podman rm basic_httpd
basic_httpd
Grey@Audron:~$ podman ps -a
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE       COMMAND     CREATED     STATUS      PORTS       NAMES
```
If any terminals had been left open inside the container, they will have automatically exited when the container is removed.

### Building a simple container

Above, I downloaded an existing image `docker.io/nginx` from a repository. 
For this project, I want to define my own.
The setup of a container is defined by a scripted that is named `Containerfile` with no file extension. 
A good way to start a container is to load an existing minimal distribution.
I chose the `trixie-slim` version of Debian as it is lightweight and [uses Python 3.13 by default](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/python3).

In [Py-Pkgs Chapter 2](https://py-pkgs.org/02-setup), they suggest using Miniconda to create an environment and the [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) package to manage dependencies. 
For this project, I decided to use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) instead as it has the ability to manage tools and add ephemeral packages when testing out builds.

I can create a minimal `Containerfile` to test running `trixie-slim` with Python 3.13 and `uv` installed.
```dockerfile
# ---- Stage 1: get uv binary ----
FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest AS uv

# ---- Stage 2: main image ----
FROM debian:trixie-slim

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# ---- System dependencies ----
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.13 

# ---- Make python command available ----
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3.13 /usr/bin/python

# ---- Copy uv from official image ----
COPY --from=uv /uv /usr/local/bin/uv

# ---- Set working directory ----
WORKDIR /workspace

# Default shell
CMD ["/bin/bash"]
```
Next, I'll build the image.
A lot of information is output to the console in the build process, so I'll collapse most of the output for brevity.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman build -f Containerfile -t test_trixie .

```

Then, I'll run the container with the following flags (see the [Podman run docs](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html) for details):
- `-i`: Interactive
    - "When set to true, make `stdin` available to the contained process. If false, the `stdin` of the contained process is empty and immediately closed."
- `-t`: TTY
    - "Allocate a pseudo-TTY. The default is false. When set to true, Podman allocates a pseudo-tty and attach to the standard input of the container. This can be used, for example, to run a throwaway interactive shell."
- `--rm`: Remove upon exit
    - "Automatically remove the container and any anonymous unnamed volume associated with the container when it exits. The default is false."
- `--name`: Container name
    - "Assign a name to the container." This can be completely different from the name of the image it is built from.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman run -it --rm --name container_name test_trixie
root@c6dc2f68fd76:/workspace# 
```
While this container is running, I can hit the refresh button in the Pod Manager sidebar to see that there is a new container named `container_name`.
I can also verify that Python and `uv` are installed inside the container.
```console
root@c6dc2f68fd76:/workspace# python
Python 3.13.5 (main, May  5 2026, 21:05:52) [GCC 14.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> exit()
root@c6dc2f68fd76:/workspace# uv --version
uv 0.11.17 (x86_64-unknown-linux-musl)
root@c6dc2f68fd76:/workspace#
```
When I am done, I can exit the container.
```console
root@c6dc2f68fd76:/workspace# exit
exit
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ 
```
Upon exiting the container, I can refresh the Pod Manager sidebar again to see that the container removed itself upon exit because of the `--rm` flag.
This is important to keep from building up a large number of idle containers when starting a particular image many times.

With this working, the next step is to build out the `Containerfile` to set up the development environment with all the necessary packages, tools, and data access.

### The `Containerfile`

Below is the current `Containerfile` used to build the image for this project.

```{literalinclude} ../../.devcontainer/Containerfile
:language: dockerfile
```

Note that this is meant to be executed via the [`start_container.sh` script](#podman_start_container).
However, if testing a new build, it can be useful to pipe the output of `podman build` to a log file using `tee`.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman build -f .devcontainer/Containerfile -t <image_name> . | tee .devcontainer/<log_file_name>.log
```

I'll explain each section of the `Containerfile` in detail below.

<a id='podman_containerfile_pin_versions'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Pinning the versions of `uv` and `trixie-slim`

For reproducibility purposes, I decided to pin the exact versions of `uv` and `trixie-slim` that my container uses. 
After [Building a simple container](#podman_simple_container), I now see the following images in the Pod Manger sidebar:
- `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest`
- `docker.io/library/debian:trixie-slim`

I can get the exact hashes of the versions of `uv` and `trixie-slim` from their manifests.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman image inspect debian:trixie-slim --format '{{.Digest}}'
sha256:e18da95f66066b7c5fa31491b524e83121271eca59a3d140f4906c8d0a090367
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman image inspect ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv --format '{{.Digest}}'
sha256:5cbec7ab7753a6c763c6dda6a38f085c8c585ec9f53cfb4e7368b79ca30bc881
```

<a id='podman_containerfile_env_vars'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Defining environment variables

The `Containerfile` defines a few environment variables to facilitate building the image.
- `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`
    - According to the askUbuntu post [DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable](https://askubuntu.com/questions/972516/debian-frontend-environment-variable), this prevents installations from getting stuck on interactive processes, such as when the user is asked to confirm or select something.
- `ENV UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/workspace/.cvenv`
    - According to the Python Developer Tooling Handbook on [How to customize uv's virtual environment location](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/how-to/how-to-customize-uvs-virtual-environment-location/), this renames the default directory for the `uv` virtual environment from `.venv` to `.cvenv` to avoid conflicts with using the environment inside vs. outside the container.
    - Note that the use of the directory `/workspace` is [detailed below](#podman_containerfile_misc_prep).
- `ENV UV_LINK_MODE=copy`
    - According to the Python Developer Tooling Handbook on [How to use `uv` in a Dockerfile](https://pydevtools.com/handbook/how-to/how-to-use-uv-in-a-dockerfile/), this "tells uv to copy files instead of hard-linking them. When using Docker cache mounts, the cache and the target directory live on separate filesystems, so uv falls back to copying anyway. Setting this explicitly avoids the warning message."

<a id='podman_containerfile_apt-get'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Installing system and scientific dependencies

The next block in the `Containerfile` uses `apt-get` to install the necessary system-level dependencies for the project. 
The flags used here are:
- `-y`: Assume yes
    - From the [Linux manual page for `apt-get`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt-get), "Automatic yes to prompts. Assume 'yes' as answer to all prompts and run non-interactively. If an undesirable situation, such as changing a held package or removing an essential package, occurs then `apt-get` will abort."
- `--no-install-recommends`: 
    - According to the askUbuntu post [How to not install recommended and suggested packages?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/179060/how-to-not-install-recommended-and-suggested-packages), this flag prevents `apt-get` from automatically installing recommended packages, keeping the container's stack to a minimum, installing only what is required.

The packages installed in this block are:
- `ca-certificates`
- `curl`
- `git`
    - For version control.
- `build-essential`
- `pkg-config`
- `unzip`
- `libnetcdf-dev`
    - For working with netCDF files.
- `netcdf-bin`
    - For working with netCDF files.
- `libhdf5-dev`
    - For working with netCDF files.
- `libcurl4-openssl-dev`
    - For establishing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for internet connections.
- `libssl-dev`
    - For establishing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for internet connections.
- `cdo`
    - [Climate Data Operators](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo)
- `nco`
    - [netCDF Operators](https://nco.sourceforge.net/nco.html)
- `python3.13`
    - The version of Python used in this project.
- `python3.13-venv`
    - For using Python in a virtual environment.
- `python3-pip`
    - For installing packages that `uv` cannot handle natively.
- `chromium`
    - For taking "screenshots" of `html` maps to produce `.png` images.
- `chromium-driver`
    - For taking "screenshots" of `html` maps to produce `.png` images.
- `fonts-liberation`

<a id='podman_containerfile_misc_prep'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Preparing Python, `uv`, and the working directory

- `RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3.13 /usr/bin/python`
    - This command creates a symlink such that using the command `python` calls Python 3.13.
    - This removes the need to specify the version of Python to use every time.
- `COPY --from=uv /uv /usr/local/bin/uv`
    - From [Using `uv` in Docker](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/), this command copies `uv` from where it was downloaded into the `usr` directory for ease of use.
- `WORKDIR /workspace`
    - This sets the working directory to be named `/workspace`.
    - The choice of the name is arbitrary, however sets a specific file path that can be expected by other parts of the project.
    - This essentially renames the root of the project directory on your computer (`seaicecp`) to be `/workspace` inside the container. 
- The next three commands set up dependency files for the virtual environment.
    - `COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./`
    - `COPY README.md ./`
    - `COPY src ./src`

<a id='podman_containerfile_uv_jupyter'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### `uv` dependencies and Jupyter kernel

The next block in the `Containerfile` is:
```dockerfile
...
# Install dependencies via `uv` and start a kernel for Jupyter notebooks
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv \
    uv sync \
 && uv run python -m ipykernel install --sys-prefix --name python3 --display-name "seaicecp (container)"
...
```

This installs and/or updates all the dependencies defined in the `pyproject.toml` file using `uv sync`.
Specifying `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/uv` will cache the packages with `uv`, making subsequent builds much faster.
Then, it starts a kernel for using the Python virtual environment in Jupyter notebooks. 

<a id='podman_containerfile_natural_earth'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Downloading commonly used Natural Earth shapefiles

When making maps, it is often useful to plot coastlines or other shapes to give context. 
A common way of doing this in Python is from Natural Earth shape files.
There are a couple of common files that the next block of the `Containerfile` downloads so that it won't need to be downloaded the first time a plot is made that requires them.
```dockerfile
...
# Trigger downloads of commonly used Natural Earth datasets
RUN /workspace/.cvenv/bin/python - <<'EOF'
import cartopy.io.shapereader as shp
shp.natural_earth(resolution='110m', category='physical', name='coastline')
EOF
...
```
If this is not present in the image, the following warning occurs when making a plot that requires downloading shape files.
```console
/workspace/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/cartopy/io/__init__.py:242: DownloadWarning: Downloading: https://naturalearth.s3.amazonaws.com/110m_physical/ne_110m_land.zip
  warnings.warn(f'Downloading: {url}', DownloadWarning)
```

<a id='podman_containerfile_esgpull'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Setting up `esgpull` install

This project uses the `esgpull` tool to download HighResMIP data files.
This next block sets up an install of `esgpull` on an external volume.
```dockerfile
...
# Set up the `esgpull` install
COPY .devcontainer/esgpull_entrypoint.sh /esgpull_entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /esgpull_entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/esgpull_entrypoint.sh"]
...
```
This uses the separate script included with this project at `.devcontainer/esgpull_entrypoint.sh` which is shown below.
```{literalinclude} ../../.devcontainer/esgpull_entrypoint.sh
:language: bash
```

The `.devcontainer/esgpull_entrypoint.sh` script assumes that the directory in which the data on the external volume is stored has been defined as `/seaicecp_data`, something which is set when executing the `podman run` command.

<a id='podman_containerfile_jupyter_server'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Setting up the Jupyter server

The last block of the `Containerfile` exposes port 8888 of the container and sets up the Jupyter server to run on that port with no password or identity token.

```dockerfile
...
# Expose the port for the Jupyter server
EXPOSE 8888

CMD ["bash", "-lc", "exec uv run jupyter lab \
    --ip=0.0.0.0 \
    --port=8888 \
    --no-browser \
    --allow-root \
    --IdentityProvider.token='' \
    --ServerApp.password=''"]
```

Note that port 8888 in the container will be set to connect to a different port (8889) on the host machine later.

---

<a id='podman_start_container'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### The `start_container` script

[The `Containerfile`](#podman_containerfile) defines how the image for this project should be built.
I created a script called `start_container.sh` which ultimately starts the container from that image, but first checks to make sure the Podman virtual machine is running and whether the image exists already.
The script is shown below:

```{literalinclude} ../../start_container.sh
:language: bash
```

This script can be run with a simple `bash` command.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ bash start_container.sh 
Starting podman machine...
Starting machine "podman-machine-default"

This machine is currently configured in rootless mode. If your containers
require root permissions (e.g. ports < 1024), or if you run into compatibility
issues with non-podman clients, you can switch using the following command:

        podman machine set --rootful

API forwarding listening on: /var/run/docker.sock
Docker API clients default to this address. You do not need to set DOCKER_HOST.

Leave this terminal running to have access to the Jupyter server and see relevant updates.
The output that continues to appear in this terminal as the Jupyter server is being used can be very helpful in debugging Jupyter-related issues.
The instructions above on how to start the container are also shown on the {doc}`Starting the Container <start_container>` page.

I'll explain each section of the `start_container.sh` script in detail below.

<a id='podman_start_container_pipefail'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Set the script to fail on common errors

The first line is `set -euo pipefail`. 
The GitHub Gist by `akrasic` called [`bash_strict_mode`](https://gist.github.com/akrasic/380bda362e0420be08709152c91ca1f9) explains that the `set` command is used to cause a script to fail very explicitly when encountering errors. 
This can be helpful to track down where exactly the bugs are, especially if the script calls other scripts. 

<a id='podman_start_container_machine_status'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Ensure the virtual machine is running

The next block checks the status of the virtual machine, which is required for running on macOS.
First, it checks whether the machine has been initialized.

```bash
...
# ---- Ensure podman machine is running (macOS) ----
if ! podman machine inspect >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "No podman machine found. Initializing..."
  podman machine init
fi
...
```
Then, it gets the state of the machine to see whether it has already been started.
```bash
...
MACHINE_STATE=$(podman machine inspect --format '{{.State}}')

if [[ "$MACHINE_STATE" != "running" ]]; then
  echo "Starting podman machine..."
  podman machine start
fi
...
```

This block allows you to re-run the `start_container.sh` script even if you already have the Podman machine running.
This is useful when testing the code in a way which requires restarting the container frequently.

<a id='podman_start_container_params'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Set the parameters

Next, the scripts sets the following parameters.

- `IMAGE="seaicecp_7"`
    - This will be the name of the image that is built. 
    - If an image with this name already exists, a new one will not be built.
    - If you want to try a new build, change this parameter.
- `CONTAINER_NAME="sicp_cont"`
    - This is the name that the container will have when it is running.
    - If you want to have multiple containers running at the same time, you might need to change this.
- `WORKDIR="/workspace"`
    - This defines the name of the working directory for the container.
    - This must be the same name used in the `Containerfile`.

<a id='podman_start_container_cleanup'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Check existing containers and images

The next two blocks clean up any existing images and builds the image, if necessary.
```bash
...
# ---- Cleanup old container if it exists ----
podman rm -f "$CONTAINER_NAME" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true

# ---- Ensure image exists ----
if ! podman image exists "$IMAGE"; then
  echo "Image $IMAGE not found. Building from '.devcontainer/Containerfile'..."
  podman build -f .devcontainer/Containerfile -t "$IMAGE" . | tee .devcontainer/build_container_log.txt
fi
...
```

The `|| true` in the first command ensures that it executes successfully, even when there is no old container to clean up. 
In the second part, the image building step will be skipped if an image with the given name already exists.

<a id='podman_start_container_external_vol'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Set up access to external volumes

The next block sets up access to data on an external volume.
The value of `SICP_DATA_DIR` should be changed to match the absolute file path of your external hard drive where `esgpull` will store the HighResMIP data.

```bash
...
# ---- Setup external hard drive access ----
export SICP_DATA_DIR=/Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/
SICP_DATA_DIR="${SICP_DATA_DIR:-}"

if [[ -n "$SICP_DATA_DIR" ]]; then
  if [[ ! -d "$SICP_DATA_DIR" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: SICP_DATA_DIR does not exist: $SICP_DATA_DIR"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
...
```
If you need to change the external volume setup, you will need to restart the Podman machine, not just the container, to see whether the change worked.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman machine stop
Machine "podman-machine-default" stopped successfully
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman machine rm
The following files will be deleted:


/Users/Grey/.config/containers/podman/machine/applehv/podman-machine-default.json
/var/folders/30/czkm3xpn6fx2v22bz_r2g37r0000gp/T/podman/podman-machine-default.sock

Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

<a id='podman_start_container_list_vol'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Create the list of volumes

The next block creates the list of arguments to be used to define the volumes.
This should include the working directory and the external volume.
```bash
...
# ---- Build volume args ----
VOLUMES=(-v "$(pwd)":"$WORKDIR")

if [[ -n "$SICP_DATA_DIR" ]]; then
  VOLUMES+=(-v "$SICP_DATA_DIR:/seaicecp_data")
fi
...
```

<a id='podman_start_container_run'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Run the container

Finally, the script starts the container with the `podman run` command.
```bash
...
# ---- Run container (Jupyter starts automatically from CMD) ----
podman run -it --rm \
  --name "$CONTAINER_NAME" \
  -p 8889:8888 \
  "${VOLUMES[@]}" \
  -w "$WORKDIR" \
  "$IMAGE"
```
The arguments of the command are, similar to [Building a simple container](#podman_simple_container) (see the [Podman run docs](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html) for details):
- `-i`: Interactive
    - "When set to true, make `stdin` available to the contained process. If false, the `stdin` of the contained process is empty and immediately closed."
- `-t`: TTY
    - "Allocate a pseudo-TTY. The default is false. When set to true, Podman allocates a pseudo-tty and attach to the standard input of the container. This can be used, for example, to run a throwaway interactive shell."
- `--rm`: Remove upon exit
    - "Automatically remove the container and any anonymous unnamed volume associated with the container when it exits. The default is false."
- `--name`: Container name
    - "Assign a name to the container." This can be completely different from the name of the image it is built from.
- `-p`: Publish (Ports)
    - "Publish a container’s port, or range of ports, to the host. Both hostPort and containerPort can be specified as a range of ports. When specifying ranges for both, the number of container ports in the range must match the number of host ports in the range."
    - This is set here as `8889:8888` to specify that the host system (my laptop) will use port 8889 (to avoid conflicts with existing Jupyter servers) to connect to the container's port 8888 where it's Jupyter server is running.
- `"${VOLUMES[@]}"`: List of volumes
    - The list of directories (`/workspace` and the external volume) that the container should have access to.
- `-w`: Working directory
    - "Working directory inside the container. The default working directory for running binaries within a container is the root directory (`/`). The image developer can set a different default with the `WORKDIR` instruction. The operator can override the working directory by using the `-w` option."
- `"$IMAGE"`
    - The name of the image to use for this container.

### Cleaning up old images

During the testing above, several images were generated.
In the Pod Manager sidebar, under the "Overview" dropdown, a summary of the images can be seen.
Usually, you will need to hit the refresh button next to this dropdown to see any information.
For the images, containers, and local volumes, it lists the total number, the number active, the disk space used, and the reclaimable disk space.

When testing out new builds of the `Containerfile`, it is easy to generate many images.
Podman can list the existing images. 
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman images -a
REPOSITORY                TAG          IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE

```
While the image for this project is a reasonable 2.78 GB, it adds up quickly when there are dozens of copies.
Podman provides an easy `prune` command to clean this up. 
When this command is run, it will remove all images that do not have an associated container that is currently running. 
This makes it convenient as I can just start a container from the image that I want to keep then, from outside that container, run a `prune` command.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman image prune -a
WARNING! This command removes all images without at least one container associated with them.

```
I can then confirm that only one image remains.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman images -a

## Virtual environment and packages

<a id='venv_activate'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Activating the virtual environment

When initializing the project, `uv` automatically creates a virtual environment in `.venv/`.
That environment can be used outside the container. 
In the section [Defining environment variables](#podman_containerfile_env_vars), I noted that I changed the default virtual environment location for `uv` to be `.cvenv` inside the container.
I can easily activate it by first starting a terminal inside the container.
```console
podman exec -it f6df1af96ed1 /bin/sh

The default interactive shell is now zsh.
To update your account to use zsh, please run `chsh -s /bin/zsh`.
For more details, please visit https://support.apple.com/kb/HT208050.
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ podman exec -it f6df1af96ed1 /bin/sh
# 
```
Then, I activate `bash` and source the virtual environment directory.
```console
# bash
root@f6df1af96ed1:/workspace# source .cvenv/bin/activate
(seaicecp) root@f6df1af96ed1:/workspace# 
```
Note that the virtual environment's name `(seaicecp)` is now at the beginning of the command prompt.

### Adding package dependencies

Using `uv` to add dependencies works similarly to `poetry` as described in [Py-Pkgs 3.6. Adding dependencies to your package](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python). 
When a `uv add <package>` command is run, that package is automatically added to [the `pyproject.toml` file](#venv_pyproject_toml).
See `uv` docs for [The project environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/layout/#the-project-environment) for more information.

<a id='venv_dependencies_datasets'></a>

#### Packages for datasets

I use `xarray` as the main workhorse to handle datasets.
```console
(seaicecp) root@f6df1af96ed1:/workspace# uv add xarray
Resolved 48 packages in 343ms
Prepared 1 package in 318ms
Installed 1 package in 11ms
 + xarray==2026.4.0
```
In order to load data from NetCDF files into an `xarray` dataset, I also need to add the `netcdf4` package.
```console
(seaicecp) root@f6df1af96ed1:/workspace# uv add netcdf4
Resolved 78 packages in 716ms
Prepared 2 packages in 3.74s
Installed 2 packages in 13ms
 + cftime==1.6.5
 + netcdf4==1.7.4
```
I also specifically added `dask` so that I can take advantage of lazy loading with `xarray.open_dataset()`. 
This allows me to filter a large dataset before actually loading the entire file into memory.
```console
(seaicecp) root@ea50d4a8fafe:/workspace# uv add dask

```

<a id='venv_dependencies_plots'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Packages for making plots

For plots, I added the `hvplot` package to be able to make `html` maps of irregular gridded data without interpolating onto a regular grid first.
```console
(seaicecp) root@ffb09d078027:/workspace# uv add hvplot
Resolved 170 packages in 2.70s
      Built seaicecp @ file:///workspace

 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///workspace)
 + tqdm==4.67.3
 + uc-micro-py==2.0.0
 + xyzservices==2026.3.0
```
Then, I added `cartopy` to have access to map projections through the submodule `cartopy.crs`.
```console
(seaicecp) root@ffb09d078027:/workspace# uv add cartopy
Resolved 178 packages in 1.40s
      Built seaicecp @ file:///workspace
Prepared 9 packages in 6.54s

 + matplotlib==3.10.9
 + pyproj==3.7.2
 + pyshp==3.0.3
 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///workspace)
 + shapely==2.1.2
```
I also added the `geoviews` package for handling physical features on maps.
```console
(seaicecp) root@ffb09d078027:/workspace# uv add geoviews
Resolved 179 packages in 643ms
      Built seaicecp @ file:///workspace
Prepared 2 packages in 503ms
Uninstalled 1 package in 13ms
Installed 2 packages in 859ms
 + geoviews==1.15.1
 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///workspace)
```
When tyring to plot data from the HadGEM3-GC models over time, I got the following error.
```console
ImportError: Plotting of arrays of cftime.datetime objects or arrays indexed by cftime.datetime objects requires the optional `nc-time-axis` (v1.2.0 or later) package.
```
It turns out that these models use the type `cftime.Datetime360Day` instead of `numpy.datetime64`, which causes issues for `matplotlib` when using time values on one of the axes.
In the GitHub issue [How to convert cftime.Datetime360Day() object to python datetime?](https://github.com/Unidata/cftime/issues/111), one of the maintainers of `xarray` mentioned that:
> "We [fixed this very recently](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/2665) in xarray by adding an optional dependency on [nc-time-axis](https://github.com/SciTools/nc-time-axis), a package that enables plotting cftime dates in matplotlib. The changes will take effect in the next version, which has yet to be released (version 0.12.0)."

Adding `nc-time-axis` indeed fixed the issue. 
```console
(seaicecp) root@fb318a3146d8:/workspace# uv add nc-time-axis
Resolved 200 packages in 697ms
      Built seaicecp @ file:///workspace

Uninstalled 1 package in 20ms
Installed 2 packages in 139ms
 + nc-time-axis==1.4.1
 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///workspace)
```
I had also tried to use [`xarray.convert_calendar()`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.convert_calendar.html) instead of installing `nc-time-axis`, but with no luck. 
They have notes in the documentation about how to deal with "360_day" calendars.
However, I still found that some dates being dropped or set to the missing value, even though all the dates are the 16th of each month.
I'm sticking with just using `nc-time-axis` as my solution.

[back to top](#top)

#### Packages for saving plots

The `html` plots that are made with `hvplot` cannot be directly saved to a `png` file. 
As a workaround, I added the packages `chromium` and `chromium-driver` to the [`Containerfile`](#podman_containerfile) in order to open an `html` plot in a browser within the container, take a "screenshot", and save that as a `png` image.
In order for that process to work, I added the `selenium` and `bokeh` packages.
```console
(seaicecp) root@ffb09d078027:/workspace# uv add selenium

 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///workspace)
```
I also added the `pillow` package for additional `png` manipulation tools.
```console

<a id='venv_dependencies_jupyter'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Packages for Jupyter notebooks

In order to use Jupyter notebooks with the `.cvenv` virtual environment, I added `ipykernel` and `jupyter`.

<a id='venv_dependencies_ext_tools'></a>
[back to top](#top)

#### Packages for external tools

I added the Python package for `cdo` to be able to call it's functions from Python scripts. 
Note that this requires that the `cdo` CLI is installed, which is done in the `Containerfile`.
```console
(seaicecp) root@94822df4851d:/workspace# uv add cdo
Resolved 199 packages in 2.61s
      Built seaicecp @ file:///workspace

>>> import cdo
>>> print(cdo.__version__)
1.6.0
```
Next, I added the `esgpull` package to be able to download HighResMIP data.
I specify the source with `git+https://github.com/ESGF/esgf-download` in order to get the latest release of the package to resolve an issue I was encountering.
```console

#### Packages for testing

In order to run tests, following [Py-Pkgs Section 3.7.2. Running tests](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#running-tests) and [Py-Pkgs Section 3.7.3. Code coverage](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#code-coverage), I installed `pytest` and `pytest-cov` as development dependencies by specifying the `--dev` group.
This means that, if someone where to install `seaicecp` as a package for their own purposes, the packages in the `--dev` group would not be installed by default.

#### Packages for documentation

Following [Py-Pkgs 3.8.4. Building documentation](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#building-documentation), I added the packages necessary to build the documentation you are reading to the `--dev` group.

### The `pyproject.toml` file

After adding all the above packages as dependencies, the `pyproject.toml` file now appears as below.
```{literalinclude} ../../pyproject.toml
:language: toml
```
When new packages are added to the project, they will be cached the next time the container is run.

### Building the package

As shown in the [Build systems](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/config/#build-systems) documentation for `uv`, I had used the `--package` flag when [initializing the repository with `uv`](#uv_init). 
In the [Building your package](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/#building-your-package) section, I used the 

```console

### Using a Jupyter notebook in the container

Instructions on how to test whether you can access the Jupyter server inside the container are shown in the {doc}`Jupyter Notebook Test <jupyter_test>` guide.
Once that is working, I can test to see whether the Jupyter server has access to the `seaicecp` package by executing a cell with the following code.
```python
import seaicecp
print(seaicecp.__version__)
```
```
0.1.0
```


### old

Great, now I'm able to generate a plot with the following code, from within the container:

```python
import xarray as xr
xr_areacello = xr.open_dataset("data/areacello_Ofx_EC-Earth3P-HR_highres-future_r2i1p2f1_gn.nc")

import hvplot.xarray
import xarray as xr, cartopy.crs as crs

test_plot = xr_areacello.areacello.hvplot.quadmesh(
    'longitude', 'latitude', projection=crs.Orthographic(-90, 77), project=True,
    global_extent=True, cmap='viridis', coastline=True
)
test_plot
```

### Adding `esgpull`

I want to try downloading more datasets to see whether they are all like this. I found the project [esgpull](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-download/quickstart/) which offers a command line interface for searching and downloading, which I think would be nice as searching on the [ESGF Federated Nodes](https://esgf-node.ornl.gov/search) is a bit tedious with the GUI. 

I'll add `esgpull` as a dependency in my project following the [installation guide](https://esgf.github.io/esgf-download/installation/) which has an example using `uv` which is great.

I came back to this later as I noticed that this didn't actually add `esgpull` to the `.toml` file.
Perhaps I should try installing it with simply `uv add esgpull`?
Would that perhaps mess up the installation I already have? Unclear. 
I could try using the flag `--dry-run` and see what would happen.

```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ uv tool install esgpull

```

Note: I needed to start a new terminal before the following would work:
```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull --version
esgpull, version 0.9.6
```

Then, I needed to do the second step of installation to allow it to write data:
```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self install
──────────────────────────────────────────────────── esgpull installation ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Install location (/Users/Grey/.esgpull): .esgpull
Name (optional): seaicecp
Creating install directory and files at /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull
Install config added to /Users/Grey/Library/Application Support/esgpull/installs.json
```

I checked the configuration because the "Server error '500 500' for url 'https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/..." got me suspicious as to why it was selected a French web domain:
```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull config
──────────────── /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/config.toml ────────────────
[paths]
data = "/Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/data"
db = "/Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/db"
log = "/Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/log"
tmp = "/Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/tmp"
plugins = "/Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/plugins"

[credentials]
filename = "credentials.toml"

[cli]
page_size = 20

[db]
filename = "esgpull.db"

[download]
chunk_size = 67108864
http_timeout = 20
max_concurrent = 5
disable_ssl = false
disable_checksum = false
show_filename = false

[api]
index_node = "esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr"
http_timeout = 20
max_concurrent = 5
page_limit = 50
default_query_id = ""
use_custom_distribution_algorithm = false

[api.default_options]
distrib = "true"
latest = "true"
replica = "none"
retracted = "false"

[plugins]
enabled = false
```

So, that was the issue. I changed the index node to be the one recommended for the USA region:

```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull config api.index_node esgf-node.ornl.gov/esgf-1-5-bridge
[api]
index_node = "esgf-node.ornl.gov/esgf-1-5-bridge"

👍 New config file created at /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull/config.toml.
```

Then, I was finally able to search:
```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull search

#### Adding `esgpull` install on an external drive

The location chosen for the install is where the data files will be stored. 
My computer's internal hard drive is not large enough to store all the data I will be working with.
To avoid filling up my hard drive, I created a separate `esgpull` install on my external disk. 

First, I confirmed the location of the install I had already done.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose
Install locations                                                                                
 *  /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull  seaicecp
```

I could not figure out how to input absolute file paths when creating a new `esgpull` install, so I first navigated my terminal to the location in which I wanted it to be.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ cd /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/
```

Then, I created a new install, giving it a memorable name
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp_data$ esgpull self install
──────────────────────────────────────────── esgpull installation ────────────────────────────────────────────
Install location (/Users/Grey/.esgpull): .esgpull
Name (optional): bergybits
Creating install directory and files at /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/.esgpull
Install config added to /Users/Grey/Library/Application Support/esgpull/installs.json
```

Now, I can navigate back to the home directory and check which install I have chosen currently.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp_data$ cd ~/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose
Install locations                                                                               
    /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull  seaicecp  
 *  /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/.esgpull 
```

I can confirm what data I've downloaded to each install by using the `show` command.
```console
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose -n bergybits
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose
Install locations                                                                               
    /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull  seaicecp  
 *  /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/.esgpull                                        bergybits 
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull show
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose -n seaicecp
Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ esgpull self choose
Install locations                                                                               
 *  /Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp/.esgpull  seaicecp  
    /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/.esgpull                                        bergybits

I took a look at the config:
```console

index_node = "esgf-node.ornl.gov/esgf-1-5-bridge"

👍 New config file created at /Volumes/BERGY_BITS/seaicecp_data/.esgpull/config.toml.

I confirmed the config changed.

#### Adding `esgpull` to the package

After doing the above, I noticed that `esgpull` had not been added to the `.toml` file.
I added it with the `uv add esgpull` command as shown below.
I'm not sure whether it would be possible to just do this instead of the `uv tool install` command I did above.

```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ uv add esgpull

### Adding `cdo`

I also added `cdo` (Climate Data Operators) to be able to interpolate the irregular grid of the model data onto a regular grid for plotting.

```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ uv add cdo
Resolved 138 packages in 469ms
      Built seaicecp @ file:///Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp
Prepared 2 packages in 113ms

Installed 2 packages in 7ms
 + cdo==1.6.1
 ~ seaicecp==0.1.0 (from file:///Users/Grey/Documents/Research/Postdoc_Projects/York_U_sea_ice/seaicecp)
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ cdo --version
bash: cdo: command not found
```

As it turns out, the command I used above only installed the Python package `cdo`, but not the actual `cdo` command line tool which is required for the Python package to work.
On the [`cdo` installation page for MacOS](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/wiki/MacOS_Platform), they show using Homebrew to install `cdo`.
```console
(seaicecp) Grey@Audron:seaicecp$ brew install cdo
```

Then, I can check to make sure `cdo` is installed by checking the version.

Then, I went into the `docs/html/index.html` in VSCodium, hit the preview button, then the top right menu to open the page in a browser.
The test webpage seems like it rendered properly.

### Hosting documentation

Following [Py-Pkgs section 3.8.5. Hosting documentation online](https://py-pkgs.org/03-how-to-package-a-python#hosting-documentation-online) to be able to have the documentation you are reading hosted on [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com).
First, a few changes need to be made to the `.readthedocs.yml` file to ensure the documentation can successfully be hosted. 
Upon generating the `cookiecutter` files, the configuration looked like this:
```yaml
# .readthedocs.yaml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for details

# Required
version: 2

# Set the OS, Python version and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.13.5"
  jobs:
    post_create_environment:
      # Install poetry
      # https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-manually
      - pip install poetry
    post_install:
      - VIRTUAL_ENV=$READTHEDOCS_VIRTUALENV_PATH poetry install --all-groups

# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py
```

Two changes need to be made here. 
The first is to specify the version of Python as `3.13` instead of `3.13.5` as Read the Docs only recognizes up to the minor version number, not the patch number.
Second, the `jobs` section needs to be changed to use `uv` instead of `poetry`.
I followed an example shown in the GitHub issue for Read the Docs [#11289, Support uv](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/11289). 
The `.readthedocs.yml` file now reads as follows.
```{literalinclude} ../../.readthedocs.yml
:language: yaml
```

Next, I went to [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and logged in. 
On the "Projects" dashboard, I clicked "Add project."
On the next page, I selected "Configure manually" then filled in this information:
- Name
    - `seaicecp`
- Repository URL
    - `https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp`
- Default branch
    - `main`
- Language
    - English

Then, I clicked "Next" and confirmed that the file `.readthedocs.yaml` exists already.
Upon building, I was greeted with confirmation that the build succeeded. 
```
Version latest / Builds / #32314755 
	git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/scheemik/seaicecp .
	git fetch origin --force --prune --prune-tags --depth 50 refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main
	git checkout --force origin/main
	cat .readthedocs.yml
	asdf global python 3.14.0
	asdf plugin add uv
	asdf install uv latest
	asdf global uv latest
	uv venv $READTHEDOCS_VIRTUALENV_PATH
	VIRTUAL_ENV=$READTHEDOCS_VIRTUALENV_PATH uv pip install --cache-dir $READTHEDOCS_VIRTUALENV_PATH/../../uv_cache -r docs/requirements.txt
	python -m sphinx -T -j auto -b html -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html
```

Now, the documentation for this project is live and available to view at [https://seaicecp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://seaicecp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
I put that URL in the "About" section of the GitHub repository under "Website" to make it more visible to people who find the project.

### Enabling $\LaTeX$ math syntax

In order to be able to use dollar signs to quickly indicate a mathematical symbol from $\LaTeX$, I added the `dollarmath` and `amsmath` extensions to the `docs/conf.py` file's `myst_enable_extensions` list.
```python
myst_enable_extensions = [
    "dollarmath", 
    "amsmath"
]
```
This allows me to render mathematical syntax, such as a speed of `$\sim$ 1 km day$^{−1}$` which renders as $\sim$ 1 km day$^{−1}$. 
See the MyST-Parser documentation page on [Syntax Extensions](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/optional.html)

<a id='doi_links'></a>
[back to top](#top)

### Enabling easy DOI links

When making citations in the documentation, it can be cumbersome to link to a DOI.
For example, to cite the EC-Earth3P-HR model, I would type out the link `[doi:10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323](https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323)` which renders as [doi:10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323](https://doi.org/10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323).
In the documentation of my {doc}`HighResMIP Choices <HighResMIP_choices>`, I make around 50 citations.

To set up a URL scheme that makes DOI links shorter, I added the following to `docs/conf.py`:
```python
myst_url_schemes = {
    "http": None,
    "https": None,
    "wiki": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{path}}#{{fragment}}",
    "doi": "https://doi.org/{{path}}",
    "gh-issue": {
        "url": "https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/issue/{{path}}#{{fragment}}",
        "title": "Issue #{{path}}",
        "classes": ["github"],
    },
}
```
Now, I can simply type out `<doi:10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323>` which renders as <doi:10.22033/ESGF/CMIP6.2323>, the same link but with many fewer characters.
See the MyST-Parser documentation page on [Customizing external URL resolution](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/cross-referencing.html#customising-external-url-resolution) for more information.
