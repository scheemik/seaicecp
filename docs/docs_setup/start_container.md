# Starting the Container

This is a short guide showing how to start the container for the project which assumes you have already followed the {doc}`Installation <installation>` page.
For details on how the container was developed, see the {doc}`Initial Setup <initial_setup>` page.

The script called `start_container.sh` will ultimately start the container for this project, but first it checks to make sure the Podman virtual machine is running (if on macOS or Windows) and whether the image for this project needs to be built or rebuilt.

This script can be run with a simple `bash` command.
```console
user@local:seaicecp$ bash start_container.sh 
Starting podman machine...
Starting machine "podman-machine-default"

This machine is currently configured in rootless mode. If your containers
require root permissions (e.g. ports < 1024), or if you run into compatibility
issues with non-podman clients, you can switch using the following command:

        podman machine set --rootful

API forwarding listening on: /var/run/docker.sock
Docker API clients default to this address. You do not need to set DOCKER_HOST.

Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully
